# TTN-ITH-Sensor

This libraries allow SP32 to:
  - Connect the SP32 microcontroller to The Things Network (LoRa WAN protocol).
  - Calculate the ITH (value obtained from Humidity and Temperature) value.
  - Two modes of get the ITH: manueally or automatically (timers).
  - Activates a maximum of 3 reles if a ITH value is reached.
  
 The goal of these libraries is to control the ITH value on industry animal farms (like cow farms), and, if a determined value is reached, activates fans to reduce it to the desired value.
